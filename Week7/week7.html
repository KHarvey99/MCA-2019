<h1> Week 7: Challenges to music creation</h1>
<p>I returned to the metadata I created in week 5, and proceeded to include the metadata from week 5 in my HTML pages with verovio.</p>

<p>The link to the new page can be found <a href="https://kharvey99.github.io/MCA-2019/Week7/myMeta.html">here</a> </p>
<p>I used a sample CSS file, as this is an element I struggle with, and tried to alter it to make it slightly different, a screenshot of the verovio can be seen below:</p>
