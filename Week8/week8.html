<h1>Music as Sound</h1>
<p>Metadata Table</p>

<p>For week 8, I have been experimenting with audio from a visual point of view. This was a new challenge for me, where, by the end of the task, I was able to compare and contrast waveforms for different songs. In order to do this, I selected 3 songs of very different genres (pop, jazz and rock) and looked at the metadata about each song before I started, to identify the technical and non-technical information about each of them (This information can be seen in the table provided above). To create an interesting visual comparison, a spectrogram was made for the songs, which I have placed below alongside their waveforms:</p>

<p>THE JAZZ TRACK</p>

<p>THE POP TRACK</p>

<p>There is evidently a very clear difference in the appearances of the waveform and spectrogram, and although each of these visuals display useful information, the spectrogram (time-frequency) unsurprisingly, has slightly more information available to analyse. The waveforms represent the the general sound recording, and gives indication into the changes in amplitude over the duration of the song (shown by the evolving up/down pattern on the x-axis against the Y-axis in the wave). This gives a general idea if the song is quite soft (low waveform) or heavy and loud (a very full waveform) at different times. On the other hand, the spectrogram provides us with a little bit more, we actually get to see the levels of frequencies that make up the entire song, from left to right of the spectrogram, we see the frequencies alter from low to high, and these represent the different notes being played on a very vague scale.</p>
