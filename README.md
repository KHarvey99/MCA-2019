Theme - *70's Disco Music*  

*Disco music* partially emerged in the late 60's, and very soon became the most iconic music genre of the 1970's. Although it is predominantly affilated with nightlife and dance scenes in the U.S, disco music continues to thrive today, with its timeless tracks abundantly being played and heard all across the globe.

## WEEK 2 TASK

### Notation

Using [Musescore](https://musescore.org/eN), I decided to re-create a classic anthem from 1977; 'Night Fever' by the Bee Gee's. I chose to conmplete 12 bars of the score, which included the introduction and first verse of the song. 

## WEEK 3 TASK 

### Encoding notaed music

I converted my museScore file from last week to MEI. Then using [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml) I was able to download the MEI file and upload it to GitHub where it can be rendered and viewed [here](https://kharvey99.github.io/MCA-2019/verovio.html).
