<h1>Audio Similarity and Transcription</h1>

  <h2> Task 1: The Similarity Matrix </h2>

<p>As we come into our final week, I will be looking into audio similarity and transcription. We were asked to select 3 new tracks of the same genre, in my case I selected 3 jazz tracks, and upload them onto a jupyter notebook template that already contained a collection of other tracks. These tracks were also of the same genres (1-3 classical songs, 4-6 rock songs) To me this similarity matrix shown above was difficult to read at first, however it is clear to see where the different songs relate and differ. My new jazz tracks (7-9) appear to be slightly more similar to the classical songs, and I think this is due to the kind if instrumentation that would be included in these genres, saying that, it could just a  be coincidence that the jazz tracks I selected are of similar sounds to classical songs. The rock songs however are not correlated to these other genres, and this is perhaps because they have much heavier and filled sound.

<h2> Part 2: Transcribing my MuseScore file </h2>

<p>We then looked into transcription, a task I was very excited to see the results from. Using Night Fever by the Bee Geeâ€™s again, I followed a step by step process in order to produce a new musescore file from an MIDI file generated from my original musescore. The results are shown in the slides below.</p>
<p>When looking back at my original musescore (the first image), compared to the new transcribed file (the second image) the differences are obvious straight away. The lyrics and the stave have disappeared, and now with only 2 staves, the notes on them are slightly messy and difficult to read. A tempo mark of 120 is now present, and the file now contains almost double the amount of bars. The key signature has changed from F major to E major, and when played, the file sounds rather different.</p>
