<h1>Music as Sound</h1>
<p>This week, I have had a brief look at music from the point of view of digital audio and especially ways to represent and analyse audio. I identified 3 music tracks of different genres and selected the most important technical and non-technical metadata associated with each music track. I composed a table which highlights the main metadata for each track which can be seen below. For each of the tracks downloaded, I computed a spectrogram (with log spaced frequency scale) for the track using SonicVisualizer. I exported the waveform and spectrogram for each which can also be seen below:</p>

<p>Task 2 of this week required a discussion on a benefit of a time-frequency analysis over a waveform- based analysis:</P
<p>One of the highlights of using time-frequency analysis over a waveform analysis is the great accessibility have to the important data of a specific track. A spectrogram shows to us the vacation in frequencies over the duration of the song, giving an indication of what notes are played when based upon the frequency. A waveform analysis is slightly harder to read, it does indicate the energy levels at a given point, but does not display numeric information. Comparing the waveform and spectrograms for the above tracks we can visually see a difference in information provided, waveform with the dynamics, and spectrogram with melody/pitch suggestions.</p>
