<p>For this part of the task, I have selected 3 new jazz tracks. 
In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 are within the classical music genre, tracks 4-6 are rock, and tracks 7-9 are my new jazz tracks.</p>

<h2> Task 2: Transcription </h2>

<p>For this task, I have decided to go back and transcribe the file I created back in week 2, Night Fever by the Bee Gees. To do this, I first exported the MuseScore file to a wav file, 
then imported it into Sonic Visualiser. I then transformed it into a piano roll,  which was then exported as a MIDI file. This MIDI file was then opened using MuseScore again, and I exported the results as an image:</p>
