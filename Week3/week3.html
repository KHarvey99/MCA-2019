  <h1> Week 3: Encoding Notated Music </h1>
		<p> I converted my museScore file from last week to MEI. Then using [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml) I was able to download the MEI file and upload it to GitHub where it can be rendered and viewed [here](https://kharvey99.github.io/MCA-2019/Week3/verovio.html). I have also attatched a screenshot of the verovio file for reference.
