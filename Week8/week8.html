<h1>Music as Sound</h1>
<p>This week, I have had a brief look at music from the point of view of digital audio and especially ways to represent and analyse audio. I identified 3 music tracks of different genres and selected the most important technical and non-technical metadata associated with each music track. I composed a table which highlights the main metadata for each track which can be seen below. For each of the tracks downloaded, I computed a spectrogram (with log spaced frequency scale) for the track using SonicVisualizer. I exported the waveform and spectrogram for each which can also be seen below:</p>
