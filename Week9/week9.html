<h1> Analysing and Extracting Meaning from Audio</h1>

<p>This week, I was working with the same 3 tracks from last week, and uploaded them all to Sonic Visualiser, where I was able to create a Spectogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient, and a chromogram for all three tracks. The screenshots of these three panes for each song can be seen below:</p>

	<p>For the second part of the task, I generated CSV files for each part, and generated histograms for these features using Jupyter notebook. The results of these can bee seen below:</p>

	<h4>TASK:</h4>
	
	<p>As part of the second task, I have decided to compare the histograms given from the mel frequency cepstral coefficients for each track. MFCC looks into the timber/tone quality of the songs. All of my tracks three tracks are from contrasting music genres and will not have the exact same tones and instruments incorprted into each piece, so the MFCC's is expected to be different for the contrasting songs. From my results above, we can see that this is almost the case, with slight similarities between the Jazz and pop tracks, this may be due to the similar insturments that are involved in the songs production, but overall, there is a clear contrast and varience across the three histograms.</p>
