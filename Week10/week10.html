<h1>Audio Similarity and Transcription</h1>

  <h2> Task 1: Generating a Similarity Matrix </h2>
  <p><img id="matrix" src="https://github.com/kharvey99/MCA-2019/blob/master/Week10/"week10screenchot/png"/> For this part of the task, I have selected 3 new jazz tracks. 
In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 are within the classical music genre, tracks 4-6 are rock, and tracks 7-9 are my new jazz tracks.
