  <h1> Week 5: Standards in Curation</h1>
	<p> This week, I have included metadata into my original MEI file that helps to indentify and describe my encoded document. I created a schema based on this data. I have included a screenshot of the code below:

  <div class="swiper-container">
    <div class="swiper-wrapper">
	<div class="swiper-slide"><img src="https://github.com/kharvey99/MCA-2019/blob/master/Week5/MEIheadings.png?raw=true"></div>
	<div class="swiper-slide"><img src="https://github.com/kharvey99/MCA-2019/blob/master/Week5/week5.png?raw=true"></div>
  </div>
    <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
    <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div>
    <div class="swiper-button-next"></div>
</div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/swiper/js/swiper.js"></script>
<script>
  var mySwiper = new Swiper ('.swiper-container', {
    direction: 'horizontal',
    loop: true,
    pagination: {
      el: '.swiper-pagination',
    },
    navigation: {
      nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
      prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
    },
  })
</script>
