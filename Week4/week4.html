<h1> Week 4: Computational analytics of notated music </h1>


<img src="https://github.com/kharvey99/MCA-2019/blob/master/Week4/ScreenshotCsv.png?raw=true">

		<p> This week, I generated a JSymbolic of my notated score, a screenshot of the CSV file can be seen above, I selected features I thought were most interesting and relevant to the piece of music. I also created a pitch histogram, piano roll, and scatterplot using music21. For the graphs, these images can also be seen in slides below:

  var mySwiper = new Swiper ('.swiper-container', {
    direction: 'horizontal',
    loop: true,
    pagination: {
      el: '.swiper-pagination',
    },
    navigation: {
      nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
      prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
    },
  })
</script>

<p>From the first pitch histogram, we can read information about the number of times a note has been performed thorughout a song. As we csan see, the most common note played is C5, which matched with my jSymbollic, as C5 has a midi pitch value of 72.0.</p>
<p>My scatter plot seen in the second image, illistrated the plots of pitch against note length, again corrosponding to my Jsymbollic.</p>
<p>The third image, the piano roll, displays the order and length of played noted throuhout the duration of the song, which is similar to the histogram, with C5 being the most commonly played note.</p>
