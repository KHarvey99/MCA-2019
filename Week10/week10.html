<h1>Audio Similarity and Transcription</h1>

  <h2> Task 1: Generating a Similarity Matrix </h2>

<p>For this part of the task, I have selected 3 new jazz tracks. 
In the similarity matrix, tracks 0-3 are within the classical music genre, tracks 4-6 are rock, and tracks 7-9 are my new jazz tracks. The matrix is telling us that tracks 0-3 and tracks 7-9 are similar to each other, and the 4-6 tracks are similar to each other. This suggets that the classical songs are similar to my chosen jazz tracks, perhaps this is due to the instrumentation and tempo of the music, which could be quite different to rock songs.

<h2> Task 2: Transcription </h2>

<p>For this task, I have decided to go back and transcribe the file I created back in week 2, Night Fever by the Bee Gees as seen in the first image. To do this, I first exported the MuseScore file to a wav file, 
then imported it into Sonic Visualiser. I then transformed it into a piano roll,  which was then exported as a MIDI file. This MIDI file was then opened using MuseScore again, and I exported the results, shown by the second image:</p>

	<div class="swiper-slide"><img src="https://github.com/kharvey99/MCA-2019/blob/master/Week10/transcription.png?raw=true"></div>
        
  </div>
    <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
    <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div>
    <div class="swiper-button-next"></div>
</div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/swiper/js/swiper.js"></script>
<script>
  var mySwiper = new Swiper ('.swiper-container', {
    direction: 'horizontal',
    loop: true,
    pagination: {
      el: '.swiper-pagination',
    },
    navigation: {
      nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
      prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
    },
  })
</script>




When looking back at my original musescore, the differences are very clear. The first noticable change is the lack of a vocal stave with lyrics that was included in the original, instead, this new file only has two. Secondly, this new file provides a tempo marking of 120, which was not included in the first file. The note positions are far more unorganised and messy, and the whole file is hard to follow, as well as sounding completeley different.</p>
