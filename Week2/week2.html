  <h1> Week 2: Notated Music </h1>
		<p> Using <a href="https://musescore.org/eN">MuseScore</a>, I decided to re-create a classic anthem from 1977; 'Night Fever' by the Bee Gee's. I chose to complete 12 bars of the score, which included the introduction and first verse of the song for piano and voice. My own transcribed verison can be downloaded from 
  <a href="https://github.com/kharvey99/MCA-2019/blob/master/Week2/NIGHT_FEVER(2).mscz?raw=true">here.</a>. An image of my musescore file canbe seen below:
