<h1> Analysing and Extracting Meaning from Audio</h1>

<p>This week, I was working with Sonic Visualiser again, where I was able to create a Spectogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient, and a chromogram for the same three tracks I worked with in week 8. The screenshots of these three panes for each song can be seen below:</p>

<h1>Making Histograms</h1>
<p>For the second part of the task, I generated CSV files for each part, and generated histograms for these features using Jupyter notebook. The results of these can bee seen below.</p> 
<p><p>fFrom looking at these set of histograms, we can see some clear differences across my pop, rock, and jazz tracks. But this is only expected, as these genres do of course differ in many ways To focus more specifically on just one feature, analysing the chromograms for the tracks provides us with some interesting, yet somewhat assumed information. Although I am still not completely confident in successfully reading these graphs, you really donâ€™t have to be an expert to see the visual difference. The chroma feature refers to the pitch class and height within the songs, and from my results, we can see that the rock track has the highest values, with the jazz track having the lowest. I would like to guess and say that this is because Jazz tracks are a lot smoother and perhaps less varied in the pitches used per song, whereas a rock song might experiment more with guitar riffs and extravagant melodies. Either way, we can conclude that the pitches do indeed vary across the board.</p>
