<h1> Week 4: Computational analytics of notated music </h1>
		<p> This week, I generated a JSymbolic of my notated score, selecting features I thought were most interesting and relevant to the piece of music. I also created a pitch histogram, piano roll, and scatterplot using music21. A screenshot of the CSV file can be seen below, with the orignial file available in the Github week folder. For the graphs, these images can also be seen in slides below:
